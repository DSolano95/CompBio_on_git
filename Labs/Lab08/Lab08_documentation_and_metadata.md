# Lab 08: Documentation and Metadata

###Goals for this lab:
* practice creating metadata files for your work
* practice using Markdown

###Exercises:
1. Complete the Markdown tutorial available at [http://www.markdowntutorial.com/](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).  
2. Re-write the README for your class repo in markdown.  If you don't have a markdown editor installed, I suggest you try [https://stackedit.io/editor](https://stackedit.io/editor).  Your new README file should have at least one heading, and some good descriptive text about the contents of the repo.  Note that your new README file should be in the top level directory of your repo (do NOT put it in a "Lab08" sub-directory, for example).
3. One of the things that the tutorial above does not go over is adding code inserts to your markdown documents.  It's very simple to markup bits of text to display as code.  This is done with backticks (i.e., " ` ", which is the mark in the upper left hand corner of your keyboard).  For example if I type:  

```
    `x <- 5`
```  
then it will look like this: `x <- 5`.
