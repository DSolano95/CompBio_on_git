# Assignment 08

### *Assignment*:
If you have not done so already, push your work from Lab 08 to Github.    
  
Your script should be in good working order, meaning:   

+ all the code works as intended
+ there are comments explaining your work that make very clear:
	- what step/problem you are working on
	- what you are doing in the steps you are taking to solve the problem


Your work should be pushed to github within 1 week of the lab (i.e., by the end of week 9)
