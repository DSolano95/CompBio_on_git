# Assignment 11: Independent Project, Step 2: <br> A fully reproducible analysis

### Announced: Thursday, 4/19

### Due: Friday, May 5th, at 11:59 p.m.

___

##### The goal of this assignment is to complete the project you outlined in [Assignment 10](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/Assignments/10_independent_project_Step1.md) in a fully reproducible way.
This means that I should be able to clone your repository, run your script(s), and get exactly the same results as you got with no error messages.

Completing Assignment 11 will require pushing a minimum of four files to your Github repo for this class:

1. Any data file(s) you used,
2. A script of all the code you used to filter, parse, analyze, and visualize the data, and
3. A markdown document describing what you did (see "[suggested format and organization](#ExampleLayout)", below).
4. Any image file(s) that is a visualization(s) of the results produced by your script.

The data file(s) should be the raw data as you obtained them.  The script should include the parsing/formatting of the raw data AND the steps you took with those data to arrive at your results.  The markdown document should explain it all (see "[suggested format and organization](#ExampleLayout)", below).

Your grade on Assignment 11 will be out of a total of 36 available points.  The breakdown of these points will be as follows:  

* All required files are present: 1 point
* Your script achieves its goals and works perfectly when I "source" it: 15 points
* Your markdown document is well written and complete: 10 points
* There is at least one visualization (figure/graph) produced by the script, and the markdown document includes the visualization(s) and an appropriate explanation of it: 3 points
* The visualization(s) produced by the script is exactly the same as what appears in the markdown document: 1 point
* Your script is well commented so I understand what it does: 2 points
* A subjective evaluation of the difficulty of your challenge and the elegance, ingenuity, and creativity displayed by your code: 4 points

# My Title

### Biological question
This question should be stated as a question that can be understood independently of knowing about the specific dataset that is being used to address it.

### Context (introduction)
This should help a naive reader make sense of what to expect and why it is interesting. It should make sense even before the reader reads the Methods. 

### Methods
##### The source of my data:
The data I used to study this question came from _________ (give FULL citations with working hyperlinks for the original publication AND the data package, if applicable).

Give a description (one or two paragraphs) of how the data were produced.

Give a description of the 

##### What the original authors did with the data:
About 1 - 2 paragraphs of explanation.

##### What _I_ did with the data and how I did it:
Verbally describe what your approach was and how you achieved it.  You don't need to include code here; rather, the goal is to give the reader an idea of what your code does and why and how it does it.  Don't give the results.

### Results and conclusions
What did you find?  How does this relate to your question?  Include at least one figure.
