1. Look up your favorite cookie recipe
2. Write it down in a plain text file
3. WINDOWS USERS: This should be a plain text file you know how to navigate to in git-bash
4. Not sure about "plain text" or how to create it?  See the [software guide](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/CourseDocuments/SoftwareRequirements.md)

### Completion:
All of the above should be done prior to lab (as noted above).  Howver, the assignment will be considered to be complete when you have successfully completed ALL steps of Lab 02, because I will be grading it based upon what appears on your GitHub account.  Don't worry, we'll do all the setup for that in lab on Friday.
