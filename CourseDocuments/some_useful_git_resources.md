# Some useful git resources:

Disclaimer: I have **not** personally vetted every single bit of advice on these. 

#### If you are **struggling** with basic operations in `git` even after the lab:
* Try working through some [interactive tutorials at Atlassian's bitbucket tutorial site](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud),which is quite good in my opinion.
* Try [https://howtogit.net/](https://howtogit.net/)
* If those basic tutorials don't help, or if you just have lingering questions, come to office hours of course!

#### Help on the command line
* For most `git` commands, you can get help on the command line like a "man page" for most UNIX commands:
```
$ git commandname --help
```
where "commandname" would be replaced by the command you are wondering about.

#### General git command reference:
* [PDF download git cheatsheet from Github](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)  
* [git cheatsheet from Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)  
* [An interactive cheatsheet from NDP Software](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html)  
* [https://howtogit.net/](https://howtogit.net/)

#### Updates to a repo during collaborative work on one repo with only one branch (or if you happen to work from two different local machines):  
* [Dealing with merge conflicts](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/merge-conflicts)  
* The [difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/difference-between-git-fetch-git-pull)  

#### Branching and merging:
* From Atlassian: [Making and using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)
* From git-scm: [An explanation of "basic branching and merging"](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)

#### Pull requests (relevant to branches and to forks):
* [A tutorial on pull requests](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)
* Github Help Pages: 
	* [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
	* [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
