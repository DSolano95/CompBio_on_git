# Software requirements and recommendations for EBIO 4420/5420 - Computational Biology

## For ALL, no matter what kind of computer and OS you have:

## For Mac Users only:
* Download and install XCode from the App Store.  Once XCode is installed, it is a good idea to install command line tools.  A decent guide for doing so is available at [http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html)
* Download and install Git from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/)
* Download and install R by following instructions at [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* Download and install RStudio by following instructions at [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/)


## For Windows Users only: 
Windows users will need to emulate a UNIX-style terminal.  There are several ways to do this.  If you have a preferred method, please use it.  If not, I suggest running VirtualBox, because that will give you a fully functional Linux operating system to use without actually having to change your Windows computer.  If you want to use VirtualBox, do the following exactly in the order given here:

1. Download (but do NOT try to open) a virtual installation CD of Ubuntu from [https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
2. Download and install VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3. Run VirtualBox and use it to set up an Ubuntu virtual machine ("vm").  This will require using the download from Step 1.  A good set of directions is available at [http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox)
4. Once all of that is done, use VirtualBox to start your Ubuntu vm (this is the vm you created as part of step 3).
5. Follow the prompts within Ubuntu to create and set up your Ubuntu user account.
6. When all of that is done, *while still in your Ubuntu vm*, follow all the steps for Linux users below.

## For Linux Users and those using VirtualBox to run Ubuntu:
* Open a Terminal window and install Git by typing `sudo apt install git` at the command prompt
* Also using the Terminal, install R and RStudio by following the instructions at [https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-r-on-linux-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus/](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-r-on-linux-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus/)
